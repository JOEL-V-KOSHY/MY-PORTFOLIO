My Portfolio Website

Hey there 👋  
Welcome to my personal portfolio!  
This is where I’ve put together all my projects, skills, and a bit about who I am as a tech learner.

🌟 What’s Inside
"Home Page:" A quick intro about me  
"Skills Page:" My key areas — Python, Data Analytics, AI, Web Dev, and more  
"Projects Section:" All my small & big projects in one place  
"Contact Section:" Reach out easily through links or social handles

💡 Why I Built This
I wanted a place that represents me — not just my resume, but my creativity and coding journey.  
So, this portfolio is my digital space to share what I’ve learned and built!

Thanks for visiting 💙
